<h1>My Personal Webpage</h1>

<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my web page!  My name is Alex Budilovsky, and I am a recent college grad residing in Northern California.  I am interested in the future of technology and how it is changing the way we work, play, and what we value as important.  I believe that technology will bring the human race tremendous positive impact, and I want to be a part of that change.
<br>
  Right now this is simply a landing page for tying together some of my projects.
